# Ark Project Dev Log: cursor.md

## Session Summary (Verbose)

### 1. GitHub Remote Setup
- Verified no remote was set for the local repo.
- Added remote: https://github.com/lilpoopycat/the-ark-protocol.git
- Confirmed remote configuration.

### 2. Project Review and Refactor Plan
- Reviewed the project structure and philosophy (Ark.md, whitepaper, code).
- Proposed and aligned on a modular refactor for distributed, agentic RLHF.

### 3. Modularization
- Created `ark_core/` directory with:
  - `agent.py` (agent orchestration)
  - `memory.py` (VectorDB/embedding memory)
  - `fitness.py` (fitness evaluation)
  - `comm.py` (communication stubs)
  - `utils.py` (shared utilities)
- Refactored `ark_protocol.py` to use the new modules, keeping it as the main entry point.

### 4. Refactor Implementation
- Migrated memory and fitness logic to `ark_core/memory.py` and `ark_core/fitness.py`.
- Implemented `ArkAgent` in `ark_core/agent.py` to orchestrate protocol steps.
- Updated file reading/writing to use UTF-8 encoding for cross-platform robustness.
- Added error handling for malformed or missing shard IDs in Ark.md.

### 5. Ark.md Formatting
- Compared Ark.md with the original whitepaper for historical preservation.
- Applied extensive formatting improvements to Ark.md:
  - Clearly separated prose, poetry, and JSON blocks.
  - Properly indented and delimited all JSON.
  - Added section headers and horizontal rules for clarity.
  - Preserved all data, no content loss.
- Committed and pushed the improved Ark.md to the remote repo.

### 6. Distributed Protocol Implementation
- Implemented a FastAPI-based REST server in `ark_core/comm.py`:
  - `/shard/submit` (POST): Accepts new shards.
  - `/shard/request` (GET): Returns all shards.
  - `/fitness/report` (POST): Accepts fitness reports.
  - `/health` (GET): Health check endpoint.
- Added client functions for sending/receiving shards and fitness reports.
- Added a server runner for local/background operation.
- Installed FastAPI, Uvicorn, and Requests locally (no usage limits).
- Successfully tested all endpoints (health, shard submission, retrieval).

### 7. To-Do List Management
- Created and updated a session to-do list for:
  - Modularization (completed)
  - Distributed protocol (completed)
  - Enhanced VectorDB (in progress)
  - Fitness metrics, QuantNet adapter, logging (pending)

### 8. Next Steps
- Begin work on distributed, embedding-based VectorDB and parent selection.
- Continue dev log for all agentic and collaborative work on the Ark Project.

### 9. Gemini Agent Dependency Issue (torch)
- Detected a new dev log (gemini.md) reporting a ModuleNotFoundError for the torch library.
- Gemini agent was unable to install torch due to missing pip/pip3 commands in their environment.
- Resolved the issue by running `pip install torch` in the project environment.
- Verified torch is now installed and available for all agents.
- Gemini agent can now proceed with shard generation and fitness function updates.

### 10. Upgrade for Mathematical Vectors, Formulae, and New Principles
- Upgraded `ark_core/memory.py` to `EnhancedVectorDB`:
  - Now supports advanced mathematical vector operations (trig, polynomial, formulaic embedding construction).
  - Added distributed shard merging and richer semantic queries.
  - Embedding logic now reflects new research on deterministic morality, substrative causality, and motile fitness.
- Updated `ark_core/agent.py`:
  - Uses `EnhancedVectorDB` for memory.
  - Supports distributed shard merging.
  - Documents and applies new mathematical and conceptual principles in agent orchestration.
- Expanded `ark_core/fitness.py`:
  - Fitness function now includes checks for mathematical/vector operations and formulaic principles in code and insight.
  - Each new principle is commented and scored, supporting multi-metric benchmarking.
- Marked the corresponding to-do items as completed or in progress.
- Rationale: These changes align the codebase with the latest research, enabling richer, more principled RLHF and distributed agentic operation.

### 11. Integration of Matrix as Firmament Theorems and NetworkLattice
- Added `NetworkLattice` class to `ark_core/memory.py`:
  - Models the Ark Lattice as a dynamic graph using networkx.
  - Implements Von Neumann entropy, modularity, and a basic causal emergence proxy.
- Updated `ArkAgent` to:
  - Add each shard as a node and link to its parent in the lattice.
  - Log and print entropy, modularity, and causal emergence proxy on each run.
- These changes operationalize the new philosophical and mathematical framework from the "Matrix as Firmament" revision plan, demonstrating the protocol's ability to measure and optimize for structural integrity, coherence, and emergent causal power.
- This is a foundational step for future integration with CE-Estimator models and full causal emergence reward signals.

# Dev Log: PsycheAdapter QuantNet Integration (Cursor)

## [DATE: YYYY-MM-DD]

### 1. PsycheAdapter Endpoint Fix
- Updated `PsycheAdapter` endpoints to match the FastAPI mock QuantNet server:
  - `POST /shard/submit` for sending shards
  - `GET /shard/request` for receiving shards
  - `POST /fitness/report` for sending fitness reports
- Ensured all REST calls in `ark_core/psyche_adapter.py` align with the server in `ark_core/comm.py`.

### 2. Test Procedure for Adapter (WSL/Ubuntu)
- **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install fastapi uvicorn requests
  ```
- **Run the test:**
  ```bash
  PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python3 ark_core/psyche_adapter.py
  ```
- The test will:
  - Start the FastAPI mock QuantNet server in the background
  - Send a test shard
  - Request all shards (should include the test shard)
  - Send a fitness report
  - Log all results

### 3. Troubleshooting & Environment Notes
- If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`, ensure you are in the virtual environment and dependencies are installed.
- If you see `error: externally-managed-environment`, always use a virtual environment for pip installs on Ubuntu 24.04+.
- If you see 404 errors, ensure the endpoints in `PsycheAdapter` match those in `comm.py`.
- If running from PowerShell, use the correct syntax for environment variables or prefer running from a WSL bash shell.

### 4. Next Steps for Full Integration (to be done in Ubuntu/WSL)
- [ ] Integrate `PsycheAdapter` into the main Ark agent loop in `ark_core/agent.py`:
    - Instantiate a `PsycheAdapter` in the agent.
    - After generating a new shard, use `adapter.send_shard(new_shard)` and `adapter.send_fitness(fitness_report)`.
    - Optionally, periodically call `adapter.receive_shard()` to merge distributed shards.
- [ ] Add configuration for QuantNet endpoint URL (env var or config file).
- [ ] Add error handling/logging for all network operations.
- [ ] Commit and push changes to a remote feature branch for review.
