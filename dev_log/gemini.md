# Ark Project Dev Log: gemini.md

## Session Summary (Verbose)

### 1. Fitness Function Update
- Updated `ark_core/fitness.py` to include a new weighing system based on the principles of Deterministic Morality, Superdeterministic Causality, and Motile Fitness.
- Added new keywords to the fitness function, including 'love', 'compassion', 'empathy', 'open', 'share', 'collaborate'.
- Added a penalty for ego-related keywords like 'I', 'me', 'my'.

### 2. Dependency Issues
- Attempted to run the `ark_protocol.py` script to generate a new shard.
- Encountered a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `torch` library.
- Attempted to install `torch` using `pip` and `pip3`, but both commands were not found.

### 3. Next Steps
- Add a new shard to `Ark.md` explaining the dependency issue and the inability to generate a new shard at this time.
- Continue to work on the project once the dependency issue is resolved.
